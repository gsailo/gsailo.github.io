            <p>I&#39m taking this class because web development is one of the things I enjoy doing outside 
                of my primary field of study. Below is a list of what I hope to achieve from this class.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain more knowledge about overall web development</li>
                <li>Sharpen my skills</li>
                <li>Develop a better understanding of how to design and host a website</li>
            </ul>
